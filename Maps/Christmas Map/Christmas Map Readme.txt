Installation
------------
To use the map, look in your "My Documents" for a folder named "Command and 
Conquer Generals Zero Hour data/Maps". If this directory doesn't exist 
(means you never played a skirmish game), play a skirmish map for a few 
minutes and comeback. The folder will be automatically created by the game. 
Extract the COMPLETE Map FOLDER (not just the individual files) included in 
the map zip file in the "/Command and Conquer Generals Zero Hour data/Maps" 
folder. Fire up the game and you should be good to go. Look for the map in 
the Unofficial Maps section.
