====- Shadow City -====


Description:
------------
A large map for 4 players. 

Fight for the control of the city and gain extra supplies with which to crush your opponents. With so many buildings to garrison, it can become an impenetrable fortress.

Centered around a dark city and an airport, with a river which runs alongside. There are bridges between bases, tech buildings and 2 extra supply warehouses. It has been designed to have choke points into each base, (leaving aside one player, who has the advantage of extra tech buildings for balance).
