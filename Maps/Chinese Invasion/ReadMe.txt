------Details------

This is a 4-player skirmish map made for Generals Zero Hour.  There is a carefully scripted video at the beginning reflecting the title of the map.  Each player has an island and has three oil derricks and one oil refinery.  Each side is a team.  Each side has a strategic island, and each side has an extra oil derrick.  Each side has at least one somewhat large city.  Also, each player has a hidden boss dozer that can be captured.  They may be difficult to find.  Space is reasonable, but not spacious.  The storyline is when China invades a GLA controlled nation and crosses a large river to enter the nation.  The GLA leader attempts to escape, but fails.

-----Installation-----

Put the map folder in:  "Computer/Documents/Command and Conquer Generals Zero Hour Data/ Maps".
On the skirmish menu, look for the tap "unofficial maps".  The map should appear there.


If you have any suggestions to make to the map, I will hear them at jroodvoets96@yahoo.com.
