Description:

- 2 player map
- California style map
- Players build their bas at the SW side and the NE side
- There are 8 tech buildings, 6 being oil derricks and 2 being artillery platforms. 2 of the oil derricks are on an island on the NW side, the artillery platforms are guarding the entrance. There is 1 oil derrick with each of the 4 supply docks and depots (2 on each side), making 4 oil derricks
- Very detailed map, it took me a while to make
- A large forest covers most of the map, this is where players build their base
- There are 2 towns located on the SE side and the NW side
- There are also 2 farms in the middle of the forest, can be useful for defending your base
