Days of Chaos

A C&C Generals 5 player skirmish map

 The war comes to the town of Peretene on lake Japurur, just north of Geniveos in Ethanthaea. The secret DNA destablization weapons project "Black Day" of Dr. Franz Huber is rumored to be baring some fruit, and all sides want the new weapon.  

Thank you for downloading my map.

Have fun
