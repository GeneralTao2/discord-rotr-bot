Formerly known as "Tournament Wilderness" this map is a grassy 4 player map designed for 2v2. There are 3 defined attack routes to each players base. In the middle there are 4 guard towers, 2 each side, the middle is quite enclosed. Each side has 3 supply docks and 3 oil derricks to go between the 2 players. Hope you enjoy and thanks for downloading!! =)
