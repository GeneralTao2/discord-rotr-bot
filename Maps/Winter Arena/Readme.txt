This is a small, winter, 2 player multiplayer/skirmish map. There are 3 small defined paths to each players base. There is a small dip in the middle where there are 2 supply docks, overlooked by 2 Guard Towers in each players base area. Each player has immediate acess to 1 supply dock, 1 oil derrick and a few supply piles. AI is fully functional. Hope you enjoy =)
