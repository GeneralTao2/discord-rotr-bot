-----Description-----
This is a 4 Player Skirmish or Multiplayer Map.  The map is overall symetrical and balanced.
There is a city in the center of the map containing resources and the quickest route across the map diagonally.
Outside the City is a wide area for movement and mini-wars among units.  There are some "hot spots" that could change the Victor of a battle located here.
Each player gets mediocre supplies and an oil refinery, More resources can be found outside of the players' bases.
If you wish to win the fight on this map, control of the city and other resources are key.
