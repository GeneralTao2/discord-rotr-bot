	How well do you think your tank tactics are? I sure hope they're good or you'll never get out of this map alive! Your main combat units are tanks! You'll be able to build every vinilla tank (Tanks that can only be built by USA, China, & GLA armies.) that exist. You won't be able to build any other combat units except rangers. So use your tanks wisely!

	Each player starts out with two supply docks and some techs nere his base. In the middle, there's a china war factory and a propaganda center. The war factory tech can build much better tanks the your normal war factory/arms dealer. The propaganda center tech allows you reserch a lot more upgrades then what you already have.

	I've left out the skirmish players because they don't know to use tanks as their main attack force.
