Command & Conquer Generals Zero Hour

Battle of Otis:  
Chapter 1
Storm clouds on the horizon
Created by: Kevin Copeland aka: Condor

Story line:

For years, residents of this sleepy village have rest under the gentle groaning of the International Bridge of Peace; A symbol of two nations coming together. But that was then…
Now there is a new sound in the air, a sound that has no meaning to peace. 

The sound of war.


Installation:

1. Unzip into your Command and Conquer Generals Data\Maps folder
2. Play and enjoy


This is the first map I built with World Builder and I was trying to learn the program as well as make a halfway decent map that I could play on. I found that building the map was almost as fun as playing it...go figure.
Total build time: 23 hrs
