Description             : This is a 8-player map set in a mountainous forest environment. Each player has a decent base area and plenty of resources. Tech buildings and more resources can be found closer towards the rivers. This map was made for the Temperate Map Pack 1, made by DaRkAlEx and the G.o.a.T.

NOTE: due to the amount of detail in the regular version, I also included a lite version of the same map. If you have a less powerful PC you might want to play that version.

Have fun :)

Special thanks to DaRkAlEx for testing map.


Installation
------------
To use the map, look in your "My Documents" for a folder named "Command and Conquer Generals Zero Hour data/Maps". If this directory doesn't exist (means you never played a skirmish game), play a skirmish map for a few minutes and comeback. The folder will be automatically created by the game. Extract the COMPLETE Map FOLDER (not just the individual files) included in the map zip file in the "/Command and Conquer Generals Zero Hour data/Maps" folder. Fire up the game and you should be good to go. Look for the map in the Unofficial Maps section.
