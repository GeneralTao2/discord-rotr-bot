*In this map you will only have 15 minutes to destroy each other, or get ready to see the nukes.
AI works fine in this map.
There are 3 supply areas, one in the middle ( the safe one ),
one in the lower middle area (not safe) and the last one
in the upper middle area (not safe too).
And forgot to mention, there are two super war factories in the middle! As the intro says.

*You can do whatever you want with the map.
